# ClientWebApp

### Client Management System
__________________________________
The project primarily serves as an exercise for basic CRUD operations using the Thymeleaf template engine. Data is presented in a tabular form, allowing the user to view information about each client, create new clients, and delete or update existing ones. Before submission, data is validated, and if necessary, error messages are displayed in the submission forms (e.g., missing required data or an already existing email address).
